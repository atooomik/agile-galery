## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

All the packages are registred in the package.json, so npm install will be enougth to install dependencies, after that npm run buid or npm run dev (edit mode) are the available commands.
